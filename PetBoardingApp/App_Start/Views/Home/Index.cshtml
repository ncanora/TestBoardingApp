            <p>
                This is a hypothetical "Pet Boarding" service webapp built using ASP.NET MVC during my intenrship with Web Surfing Studios. This webapp was built
                with features such as creating and managing user accounts, managing pets, and managing bookings. Accounts, Pets, and Bookings are all stored on a SQL Server database.
                Additionally, admin tools are available for managing user accounts, pets, and bookings. Either create a new account or login to an existing account to get started.
